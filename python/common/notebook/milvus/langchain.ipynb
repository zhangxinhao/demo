Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom-up to handle embedding vectors converted from unstructured data.\\nAs the Internet grew and evolved, unstructured data became more and more common, including emails, papers, IoT sensor data, Facebook photos, protein structures, and much more. In order for computers to understand and process unstructured data, these are converted into vectors using embedding techniques. Milvus stores and indexes these vectors. Milvus is able to analyze the correlation between two vectors by calculating their similarity distance. If the two embedding vectors are very similar, it means that the original data sources are similar as well.', metadata={'source': 'https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md', 'title': 'Introduction Milvus documentation', 'description': 'Milvus is an open-source vector database designed specifically for AI application development, embeddings similarity search, and MLOps v2.3.x.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"Developer tools\\nMilvus is supported by rich APIs and tools to facilitate DevOps.\\nAPI access\\nMilvus has client libraries wrapped on top of the Milvus API that can be used to insert, delete, and query data programmatically from application code:\\n\\nPyMilvus\\nNode.js SDK\\nGo SDK\\nJava SDK\\n\\nWe are working on enabling more new client libraries.
